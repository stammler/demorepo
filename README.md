# Demo Repository

This repository serves as demonstration for the implementation of
unit tests to a project including analysis of code coverage.


It furthermore contains a minimum working example for the
creation of a documentation with Sphinx, as well as the
required infrastructure to host the documentation at
Read the Docs.

This repository has been used in the Code Coffee seminar at the
University Observatory of the Ludwig Maximilian University
of Munich.
